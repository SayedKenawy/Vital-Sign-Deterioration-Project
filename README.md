## Description
This repository provides a publicly available dataset containing clinically relevant features associated with Parkinson’s disease. The dataset has been compiled and organized to support exploratory data analysis, statistical investigation, and reproducible research in the biomedical and health informatics domains.

Each record represents an individual subject, while the accompanying features capture measurable clinical attributes commonly used in Parkinson’s disease studies. The dataset is shared in its raw form to preserve data integrity and allow researchers to apply their own preprocessing, validation, and analytical strategies.

The primary objective of releasing this dataset is to promote transparency, comparability, and reproducibility across Parkinson’s disease research, as well as to support educational use, benchmarking, and independent validation studies. This repository contains data only and does not include models, algorithms, or implementation-specific methodologies.
